Enumerable-Drop-Out-Stack
=========================

This an Enumerable-Drop-Out-Stack based on an array of a fixed size.

Also included is a CHM help file.

It has one public constructor which takes in the capacity/size of the stack to be generated.

At the moment there seems to be a problem with the reverse function from this enumerable collection.

Will take a look into this again later.
